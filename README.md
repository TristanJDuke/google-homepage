This Project is a quick practice for building a webpage and with this project I will practice my Chrome Dev-Tools skills as well as practice my CSS and HTML proficiency.

Two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
